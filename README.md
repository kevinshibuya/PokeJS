This project was made to solidify what I learned on chapters I and II of the [Rocketseat ReactJS Ignite course](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/ignite).

A live version can be found [here](https://shibuya-pokejs.netlify.app/).

Project powered by [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

## üöÄ Features

- All the data from the Pokemons available on PokeAPI
- Searchbar and order by systems
- Pagination system
- Detailed view of each individual Pokemon
- Add/remove Pokemon to/from your Favorites
- Fully responsive

## üíª Tech

PokeJS uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- **ReactJS + Typescript** - The foundation
- **React Icons** - Yeah, icons
- **React Palette** - Used to make the background color of the pokemon page change, based on the most vibrant color of the pokemon image
- **React Router Dom** - Did all the application routing
- **React Spring** - Animation library, used on the pokemon page
- **React Modal** - Used to make the note when you first load the project
- **Styled Components** - Really great library for styling on ReactJS applications

And of course PokeJS itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/kevinshibuya/PokeJS) on GitHub.

## üé® Design

Since I am just a programmer, this project design was based on the works of [AC1design](https://dribbble.com/AC1design) -  [Pokedex Website Redesign Concept](https://dribbble.com/shots/15128634-Pokemon-Pokedex-Website-Redesign-Concept).
